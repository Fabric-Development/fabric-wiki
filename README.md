# Fabric Wiki

This is the source code for the new (WIP) wiki website for [Fabric](https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric)

# Why?

While I think is that mdBook is **really** awesome when it comes to it as a markdown SSG, that's good and all but the issue with it is that I've found it too hard to do little to know customization.

What pushed me to use Starlight is that its ability to use MDX and custom components which's an awesome feature and I see how it can improve how Fabric's wiki can look and feel.

So, I'm now committed to port the [existing wiki](https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric-wiki) (made using mdBook) over to Starlight and Astro!
