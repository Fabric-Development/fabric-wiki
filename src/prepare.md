# Prepare
Here's some stuff to prepare before hopping into Fabric...
## Python
Fabric is an advanced and complex Python library. To take advantage of the full capabilities of Fabric, you should at least know the basics of Python and have some understanding of the following concepts:

- Packages: Installing packages via `pip` and using virtual environments
- Variables & Data Types
- Functions with both `def` and `lambda`
- Conditionals
- Loops: For- and while-loops
- Exception Handling: `try`, `except`, `finally`
- Classes and Object-Oriented Programming

For Python learning tools, see the [resources page](resources.md).

## GTK
If you plan to hack into Fabric and create your own widgets or contribute, you will need some understanding of GTK. GTK learning resources are similarly listed in the [resources page](resources.md).

## Ready?
Assuming you already have Fabric installed by following [this guide](installation-guide.md), let's get started by [writing your first widget](first-widget.md)!
