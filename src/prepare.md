# Prepare
Here's some stuff to prepare before hopping into Fabric...
## Python
Fabric is an advanced and complex Python library. To take advantage of the full capabilities of Fabric, you should at least know the basics of Python and have some understanding of the following concepts:
- Packages: Installing packages via `pip` and using virtual environments
- Variables & Data Types
- Functions with `def` and `lambda`
- Conditionals
- Loops: For- and while-loops
- Exception Handling: `try`, `except`, `finally`
- Classes and Object-Oriented Programming
