# Welcome to Fabric!

Hi! Welcome to the documentation of Fabric, a pretty great [Python](https://www.python.org) widgets framework for *Nix. Keep in mind that these docs are a work in progress (just like the library itself), so some sections might not be completed yet. 

If you're looking for information on what Fabric is, its features, or a showcase, check out the [README](https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric) in the source repository.

## Where to Start
If you're completely new to the library, you should first [install it](installation-guide.md) and probably [a stubs package](installing-stubs.md) as well. Once you have that, you can go ahead and [make your first widget](first-widget.md)!

If you have any issues, check the [FAQ](faq.md) or join us at the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3sDbYc9SZP)!
