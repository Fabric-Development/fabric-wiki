# The CLI utility and client

When you start fabric (using the `start` function) Fabric will start executing the GTK main thread and it will also start a DBus client at the same time, this client makes you able to execute code on the fly and get information about your configuration file (still not a lot of features (yet)), Fabric grabs all of your globals and locals so when you execute code using the client you get all of your variables, object or/and modules.

The CLI utility is just a command line tool to use the client instead of dealing with DBus communications yourself.

## usage

```
$ python -m fabric --help
Usage: python -m fabric [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  execute  executes a python code within the running fabric instance
  info     gets info about the currently running fabric instance
```

## examples

```
$ python -m fabric info -j
{'file': '/home/<user>/.config/fabric/bar.py'} # this is just an example, your output might differ, outupt is in json format because of the -j flag
```

```
$ python -m fabric execute "bar.hide()" -j # executing python code
{'source': 'bar.hide()', 'exception': ''} # no errors
```

```
$ python -m fabric execute "bar.this_method_does_not_exist()" -j # error should return
{'source': 'bar.this_method_does_not_exist()', 'exception': 'AttributeError("\'StatusBar\' object has no attribute \'this_method_does_not_exist\'")'} # there's an error, the exception got returned by fabric
```
