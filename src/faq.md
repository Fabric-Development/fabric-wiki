> [!TIP]
> if you're using Fabric inside a virtual environment managed by something other than the `venv` module included by `python` and you're getting import errors (and all dependencies exist) , you can try using Fabric in a virtual environment generated by `python -m venv venv`

### Audio service/widget is not working

`libcvc` is missing, clone Fabric and install `libcvc` using the script included (`scripts/install_libcvc`)

### My window does not show up

This can be fixed by following these debugging steps

-   Check that you don't have any blocking code that runs before Fabric, (i.e doing web requests)
-   Check if the window is showed using the `show_all` function

# Wayland

### My window size goes crazy for a second and goes back to normal state

This is a known issue when showing up an empty GTKLayerShell window on wl-roots compositors, a fix is to make sure not to show up any window as long as it's empty, you can set the `show_all` argument to `False` until you add a child to the window and later you can use the `.show_all()` method to show up the window

### My window show up as a normal window not a layer

This might happen if the `GDK_BACKEND` environment variable is set to `x11` or anything other than `wayland`, also this might happen if your compositor does not support the `layer-shell` protocol (e.g. GNOME is refusing to implement the protocol, [source](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/1141#note_482766))

If your compositor support the protocol, a fix for this issue will be by setting the `GDK_BACKEND` variable to `wayland` (e.g. `env GDK_BACKEND=wayland python path/to/fabric/config`)

### My eventbox isn't eventboxing properly

If you're on hyprland try downgrading to `0.28.0`, this is a known issue with hyprland layer surfaces
if not hyprland then it's better to provide more information via reporting this issue in our discord server or a github issue

### My widget ain't blurring it's background on hyprland

Simple as adding these lines into your hyprland config

```
layerrule = blur, fabric
layerrule = ignorezero, fabric
```

# X11/Xorg

> [!WARNING]
> Fabric's X11/Xorg backends are still experimental, issues might occur

### Can't add margin to my window

Try setting the window type to `"popup"`

### My window has rounded corners that i didn't set

Checkout your compositor configuration, it might be setting a rounded corners for Fabric windows

### When i set my window to have transparency i get black background color

This might be caused due to you begin having no running compositor, checkout picom or compton
