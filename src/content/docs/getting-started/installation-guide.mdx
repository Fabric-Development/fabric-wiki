<Steps>
1. **Install Python**

    Fabric requires Python version 3.11 or later. Check your distribution's instructions or package manager to get the required version.

    * Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S python` for the most recent version
    * OpenSUSE: `sudo zypper install python311` for the most recent version of Python 3.11
    * Fedora: It already comes with Python preinstalled, but if it doesn't: `sudo dnf in python`

2. **Install the Dependencies**

   Fabric requires the following dependencies to run:

   - `gtk3`
   - `cairo`
   - `gtk-layer-shell`
   - `libgirepository`
   - `gobject-introspection`
   - `gobject-introspection-runtime`
   - `python`
   - `python-pip`
   - `python-gobject`
   - `python-cairo`
   - `python-loguru`
   - `pkgconf`

   <Aside>
     Names of packages and installation instructions vary across distributions
     and systems. You may have to do some searching for your system.
   </Aside>

   Run the following command to install all the dependencies:

       gobject-introspection-devel python311 python311-pip python311-gobject
       python311-gobject-cairo python311-pycairo python311-loguru pkgconf`
     </TabItem>

       _(tested on Fedora 42)_

       * `sudo dnf install gtk3-devel cairo-devel gtk-layer-shell-devel 
       glib2 gobject-introspection-devel python3-devel python-pip 
       python3-gobject python3-cairo python3-loguru pkgconf`
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. **Install Fabric**

   You can either install Fabric globally (not recommended) or in a virtual environment.
</Steps>

### Virtual Environment

The recommended way to install Fabric is through a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv).

<Steps>
1. To install this way, first make a folder for your new project (which is going to include your new config file):
    ```bash
    mkdir <your-folder-name>
    ```
2. change directories to this new folder:
    ```bash
    cd <your-folder-name>
    ```
3. Create a new virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Source the newly created virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
5. You can now install Fabric in your newly-created virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric.git
    ```
</Steps>

### Global Install

Alternatively, you can install Fabric globally using the following command:

<Aside type="tip">
  **If you're on Arch Linux**, Fabric is available in the AUR under the name
  `python-fabric-git`. If you use a different distribution and you would like to
  install Fabric globally, use the following command.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  **If you're on NixOS**, Fabric is available in the form of a Nix Flake, see this [PR](https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric/pull/42) for more info.
</Aside>

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric.git
```

This method is more prone to dependency issues.

Congrats! Fabric is now installed, and you can run and use it as long as you would like. To get auto-completion and type annotation functionality in your text editor, head over to the [stubs installation guide](./stubs-guide.mdx).
