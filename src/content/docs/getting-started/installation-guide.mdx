<Steps>
1. **Install Python**

    Fabric requires Python version 3.11 or later. Check your distribution's instructions or package manager to get the required version.

    * Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S python` for the most recent version
    * OpenSUSE: `sudo zypper install python311` for the most recent version of Python 3.11
    * Fedora: It already comes with Python preinstalled, but if it doesn't: `sudo dnf in python`

2. **Install the Dependencies**

   Fabric requires the following dependencies to run:

   - `gtk3`
   - `cairo`
   - `gtk-layer-shell`
   - `libgirepository`
   - `gobject-introspection`
   - `gobject-introspection-runtime`
   - `python`
   - `python-pip`
   - `python-gobject`
   - `python-cairo`
   - `python-loguru`
   - `pkgconf`

   <Aside>
     Names of packages and installation instructions vary across distributions
     and systems. You may have to do some searching for your system.
   </Aside>

   Run the following command to install all the dependencies:

     <TabItem label="Arch Linux">
       * `sudo pacman -S gtk3 cairo gtk-layer-shell libgirepository
       gobject-introspection gobject-introspection-runtime python python-pip

     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="OpenSUSE">
       _(tested on Tumbleweed)_

       * `sudo zypper install gtk3-devel cairo-devel

       gobject-introspection-devel python311 python311-pip python311-gobject
       python311-gobject-cairo python311-pycairo python311-loguru pkgconf`
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Fedora">
       _(tested on Fedora 42)_

       * `sudo dnf install gtk3-devel cairo-devel gtk-layer-shell-devel
       glib2 gobject-introspection-devel python3-devel python-pip
       python3-gobject python3-cairo python3-loguru pkgconf`
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. **Install Fabric**

   You can either install Fabric globally (not recommended) or in a virtual environment.
</Steps>

### Virtual Environment

The recommended way to install Fabric is through a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv).

<Steps>
1. To install this way, first make a folder for your new project (which going to include your new config file):
    ```bash
    mkdir <your-folder-name>
    ```
2. change directories to this new folder:
    ```bash
    cd <your-folder-name>
    ```
3. Create a new virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Source the newly created virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
5. You can now install Fabric in your newly-created virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric.git
    ```
</Steps>

### Global Install

Alternatively, you can install Fabric globally using the following command:

<Aside type="tip">
  **If you're on Arch Linux**, Fabric is available in the AUR under the name
  `python-fabric-git`. If you use a different distribution and you would like to
  install Fabric globally, use the following command.
</Aside>

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric.git
```

This method is more prone to dependency issues.

### Nix

Fabric can also be installed via Nix Flake.

<Steps>
1. Add Fabric to the flake's inputs:
    ```nix
    {
      inputs = {
        nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
        fabric = {
          url = "github:Fabric-Development/fabric";
          # ! Important to override
          # Nix will not allow overriding dependencies if the input
          # doesn't follow your system pkgs
          inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
        };
      };
    }
    ```

2. Then, add the following to ``nixpkgs.overlays``:
    ```nix
    fabric.overlays.default
    ```

3. Then you can add the following to ``environment.systemPackages`` or ``home.packages``:
    ```nix
    pkgs.python-fabric
    ```

    or optionally, for exposing any additional packages to Fabric use `extraPackages`, and/or for any additional Python dependencies use `extraDependencies` as follows:
    ```nix
    # `environment.systemPackages` is also fine
    home.packages = [
      (pkgs.python-fabric.override {
        extraPackages = [
          # Add additional packages here
          # For example:
          pkgs.pipewire
        ];
        extraDependencies = [
          # Add extra Python dependencies here
          # For example:
          pkgs.python3Packages.pillow
        ];
      })
    ];
    ```

    You can make Fabric accessible to the system Python interpreter, for it to be used by the LSP server of your text editor, by doing this instead:
    ```nix
    # `environment.systemPackages` is also works the same way
    home.packages = [
      (python3.withPackages (ps: pkgs.python-fabric.override {
        extraPackages = [
          # Add additional packages here
          # For example:
          pkgs.pipewire
        ];
        extraDependencies = with ps; [
          # Add extra Python dependencies here
          # For example:
          pillow
        ];
      }))
    ];
    ```
</Steps>

<Aside>
    When installed via Nix, to run Fabric you should use the command `fabric` instead of `python -m fabric`.

Congrats! Fabric is now installed, and you can run and use it as long as you would like. To get auto-completion and type annotation functionality in your text editor, head over to the [stubs installation guide](./stubs-guide.mdx).
