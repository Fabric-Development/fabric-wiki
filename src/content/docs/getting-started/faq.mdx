<Aside>
  If you're using Fabric inside a virtual environment managed by something other
  than the `venv` module included by `python` and you're getting import errors
  (and all dependencies exist), try using Fabric in a virtual environment
  generated by `python -m venv venv`.

# General

### Audio service/widget is not working

`libcvc` is probably missing, clone Fabric and install `libcvc` using the script included (`scripts/install_libcvc`).

### My window does not show up

Try the following debugging steps:

- Check that you don't have any blocking code that runs before Fabric (e.g doing web requests)
- Check if the window is shown using the `show_all` function

# Wayland

### My window size goes crazy for a second and goes back to normal size

This is a known issue when showing an empty GTKLayerShell window on wl-roots compositors. A workaround is to make sure not to show any windows that are empty; you can set the `show_all` argument to `False` until you add a child to the window. You can use the `.show_all()` method to show the window once you do.

### My window shows up as a normal window, not a layer

This might happen if the `GDK_BACKEND` environment variable is set to `x11` or anything other than `wayland`; this may also happen if your compositor does not support the `layer-shell` protocol (e.g. [GNOME is refusing to implement the protocol](<(https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/1141#note_482766)>))

If your compositor supports the protocol, you can fix this issue by setting the `GDK_BACKEND` variable to `wayland` (e.g. `env GDK_BACKEND=wayland python path/to/fabric/config`).

### My eventbox isn't eventboxing properly

If you're on [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org), this is a known issue with hyprland layer surfaces. (last known version to be working fine is `0.28.0`)

If you're not on Hyprland, provide more information through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric-wiki/issues) or [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/xKDnfGee).

### My widget isn't blurring its background on hyprland

Add these lines into your hyprland config:

```conf
layerrule = blur, fabric
layerrule = ignorezero, fabric
```

# X11/Xorg

<Aside>
  Fabric's X11/Xorg backends are still experimental; issues might occur.
</Aside>

### I can't add margin to my window

Try setting the window type to `"popup"`.

### My window has rounded corners that I didn't set

Check your compositor configuration; it may be setting rounded corners for Fabric windows.

### When I set my window to have transparency, I get a black background color

This may be caused due to you begin having no running compositor; check out [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) or [compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton) (no longer maintained).
