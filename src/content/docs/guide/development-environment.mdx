This page will walk you through setting up your development environment for Fabric.

# Fabric Source

To start developing, you should grab the latest commit of Fabric so that you're up-to-date.

To do this, run this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric
```

<Aside>
Cloning the source repository this way will create a new folder in your current working directory.

You can then change your directory into this newly created clone.

```bash
cd fabric
```

# Virtual Environment

<Aside>
You can continue inside an integrated terminal now if you prefer. For this example, we use VSCode:

```bash
code .
```

</Aside>

Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Source your new virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

We now have a separate environment for packages.

Finally, install the current Fabric source in place as a package:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

And you're ready! Continue on [this page](./hacking-guide.mdx) to start hacking.
