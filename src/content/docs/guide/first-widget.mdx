Assuming you have [Fabric installed](../getting-started/installation-guide.mdx), it's time to write your first widget!

## The Basics

Here's an example of using Fabric to define a simple widget - you don't have to understand every line yet, since this guide will walk you through it.

```python
import fabric # importing the base package
from fabric import Application
from fabric.widgets.label import Label # gets the Label class
from fabric.widgets.window import Window # grabs the Window class from Fabric

window = Window( # creates a new instance of the Window class and assign it to the `window` variable
  child = Label("Hello, World"), # creates a new Label instance with the content being "Hello, World" and assigns it as a child of the window
  all_visible=True # to make the window and all of its children appear once the config runs
)

app = Application("default", window) # define a new config named "default" which holds `window`
app.run() # run the event loop (run the config)
```

Run the code using `python path/to/your/file.py`

if everything goes fine, you should see a regular window that looks like this:

![](/assets/first-widget-label.png)

This code first imports Fabric and the widgets we need to use -- a Window and a Label. It creates a new instance of each widget, with the Label being initialized with the text "Hello, World". It then adds the label widget to the window, shows the window and all of its children, and starts fabric so the window is rendered.

"Now what?" Now, we do some real stuff!

## Level 1: Boxes

Now let's demonstrate some boxes with some labels.

```python
import fabric # importing the base pacakge
from fabric import Application # prepare the application class which manages multi-config setups
from fabric.widgets.box import Box # gets the Box class
from fabric.widgets.label import Label # gets the Label class
from fabric.widgets.window import Window # grabs the Window class from Fabric


if __name__ == "__main__":
    box_1 = Box(
        orientation="v", # vertical
        children=Label(label="this is the first box")
    )
    box_2 = Box(
        spacing=28, # adds some spacing between the children
        orientation="h", # horizontal
        children=[
            Label(label="this is the first element in the second box"),
            Label(label="btw, this box elements will get added horizontally")
        ]
    )
    box_1.add(box_2) # append box_2 inside box_1 along with the label already in there

    window = Window(child=box_1) # there's no need showing this window using `show_all()`; it'll show them itself because the children are already passed
    app = Application("default", window) # define a new config named "default" which holds `window`

    app.run() # run the event loop (run the config)

```

Result (notice the alignment of the labels):

Here's a visual representation for more clarity:

You probably now have an understanding of how box containers can work with different orientations. Let's keep going.

## Level 2: Buttons

First, here's the code:

```python
import fabric
from fabric import Application
from fabric.widgets.box import Box
from fabric.widgets.label import Label
from fabric.widgets.button import Button
from fabric.widgets.window import Window

def create_button(): # define a "factory function"
    return Button(label="Click Me", on_clicked=lambda b, *_: b.set_label("you clicked me"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    box = Box(
      orientation="v",
      children=[
        Label(label="Fabric Buttons Demo"),
        Box(
          orientation="h",
          children=[
            create_button(),
            create_button(),
            create_button(),
            create_button(),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    )
    window = Window(child=box)
    app = Application("default", window)

    app.run()

```

Result:

![](/assets/first-widget-button.png)

This demo creates a window with a box inside of it with the orientation set to vertical (for now, let's call it the first box). The first child inside that box is a label with the text "fabric buttons demo", and the second child inside the first box is another box. Let's call this the second box. This second box has 4 buttons, with each button created by a function that handles creating and connecting them. Since individual instances of widgets can't be children of other widgets twice, the `create_button` function creates completely new instances of Fabric buttons. These buttons' `button-press-event` signals are then connected to an anonymous function that changes the label to "you clicked me" when they are pressed by the user.

<Aside>
  When you write a widget using Fabric, you're actually creating a genuine GTK
  widget under the hood! Fabric's purpose is to simplify and add an enjoyable
  touch to the widget-making process. As we delve into widget creation, we
  might, for instance, nest a button within a box or embed text inside a button.
  This approach to defining widgets will feel remarkably familiar to frontend
  developers and those who have experience writing HTML.
</Aside>

## Level 3: Simple Bar

Now that you are familiar with using buttons and boxes, we will apply these concepts to create a basic status bar.

### Importing Additional Widgets

Let's begin by importing some additional widgets:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Wayland">
  
  ```python
  ...
  from fabric.widgets.datetime import DateTime
  from fabric.widgets.centerbox import CenterBox
  from fabric.widgets.wayland import WaylandWindow as Window  # Replace the previous Window import with this
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="X11">
  
  ```python
  ...
  from fabric.widgets.datetime import DateTime
  from fabric.widgets.centerbox import CenterBox
  from fabric.widgets.x11 import X11Window as Window  # Replace the previous Window import with this
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You might be wondering why we specifically use the `WaylandWindow` or `X11Window` classes. This distinction becomes clearer when you understand the differences between regular windows and _layer_ windows:

- **Regular `Window`**: This is a typical window that can be moved, closed, minimized, or maximized by your window manager. Regular windows are more suited for desktop applications rather than desktop widgets.
  
- **_Layer_ Window (`WaylandWindow` and `X11Window`)**: This transforms a standard application window into a desktop widget. Each display protocol has its own specific window type: `X11Window` for X11/XOrg and `WaylandWindow` for the Wayland protocol.

### Writing the Widget

To organize our code, we will create a `StatusBar` class that inherits from the appropriate `Window` class.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Wayland">
        ```python
        ...
        class StatusBar(Window):
            def __init__(self, **kwargs):
                super().__init__(
                    layer="top",  # Ensure it stays above other apps
                    anchor="left top right",  # Anchors the bar at the top, stretching from left to right
                    exclusivity="auto",  # Reserves space for the bar so it behaves like a normal window
                    **kwargs
                )
        ```
        
        <h4>Understanding the Arguments</h4>

        Let's take a closer look at the arguments used in the `StatusBar` class:
        - `layer`: Ensures that your bar stays visible above any regular applications (except when they are in fullscreen mode. use the `overlay` layer type place it on top of everything). for Hyprland users, to see a list of open layers, use the `hyprctl layers` command.
        - `anchor` (Wayland only): Determines the bar's position. For this guide, we want our bar to be at the top, extending from left to right, so we use `left top right`.
        - `exclusivity` (Wayland only): Ensures that the bar has its own dedicated space and is not overlapped by other windows or widgets.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="X11">
        ```python
        ...
        class StatusBar(Window):
            def __init__(self, **kwargs):
                super().__init__(
                    layer="top",  # Ensure it stays above other apps
                    geometry="top",  # Position it at the top of the screen
                    type_hint="dock",  # Inform the window manager that this is a dock-like window
                    **kwargs
                )
        ```
        <h4>Understanding the Arguments</h4>

        Let's take a closer look at the arguments used in the `StatusBar` class:
        - `layer`: Ensures that your bar stays visible above any regular applications (except when they are in fullscreen mode. use the `overlay` layer type place it on top of everything).
        - `geometry` and `type_hint` (X11 only): `geometry="top"` places the bar at the top of the screen, while `type_hint="dock"` signals to the window manager that the bar should be treated as a dock.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Running the Bar

Now let's see our creation in action!

```python
...
if __name__ == "__main__":
    bar = StatusBar()
    app = Application("bar", bar)
    app.run()
```

The bar itself will not be visible yet (since it’s unstyled and empty (it's height is equal to zero)), but you _might_ notice that it has already reserved some space on your screen.

### Adding Widgets to the Bar

Now, let's add some content to our status bar (a `DateTime` widget for this example). To make positioning easier, we'll use a `CenterBox` to manage the placement of elements within the bar.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Wayland">
    ```python
    ...
    class StatusBar(Window):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(
                layer="top",
                anchor="left top right",
                exclusivity="auto",
                **kwargs
            )

            self.date_time = DateTime()
            self.children = CenterBox(center_children=self.date_time)  # Adds the CenterBox with date_time in the center of the bar
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="X11">
    ```python
    ...
    class StatusBar(Window):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(
                layer="top",
                geometry="top",
                type_hint="dock",
                **kwargs
            )

            self.date_time = DateTime()
            self.children = CenterBox(center_children=self.date_time)  # Adds the CenterBox with date_time in the center of the bar
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With this setup, the date and time widget will be neatly centered within the bar using the `CenterBox`.

### Final Code Example

Here's the full code to create your simple status bar:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Wayland">
    ```python
    import fabric
    from fabric import Application
    from fabric.widgets.datetime import DateTime
    from fabric.widgets.centerbox import CenterBox
    from fabric.widgets.wayland import WaylandWindow as Window

    class StatusBar(Window):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(
                layer="top",
                anchor="left top right",
                exclusivity="auto",
                **kwargs
            )

            self.date_time = DateTime()
            self.children = CenterBox(center_children=self.date_time)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        bar = StatusBar()
        app = Application("bar-example", bar)
        app.run()
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="X11">
    ```python
    import fabric
    from fabric import Application
    from fabric.widgets.datetime import DateTime
    from fabric.widgets.centerbox import CenterBox
    from fabric.widgets.x11 import X11Window as Window

    class StatusBar(Window):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(
                layer="top",
                geometry="top",
                type_hint="dock",
                **kwargs
            )

            self.date_time = DateTime()
            self.children = CenterBox(center_children=self.date_time)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        bar = StatusBar()
        app = Application("bar-example", bar)
        app.run()
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
