Services (also referred to as `Object`s) are Python classes designed to perform specific tasks. Each service encapsulates a distinct functionality and can have multiple _accessories_. These accessories include Properties and Signals, which allow the service to expose its state and notify users about important events. Services are typically subclasses of `GObject.Object`.

### Core Elements of a Service

1. **Service**: A service represents the core functionality encapsulated in a class. for example, we have a service called a `Fabricator` that polls data from a specific source (whether a Python function or a shell script). The service continuously polls these sources at a defined interval and manages the data flow into one of its properties.

2. **Properties**: Properties in a service represent the state or data managed by the service. For instance, a `Fabricator` service contains a property called `value` which stores the result of the polling process. When this property changes, the service can trigger signals to inform other components of the application.

3. **Signals**: Signals allow a service to communicate state changes or events. In the case of `Fabricator`, when the `value` property is updated, a signal called `changed` is emitted. This informs listeners that the `Fabricator` has new data. Additionally, a more specific signal tied to the property itself, `notify::value`, is emitted, indicating that the `value` property has been modified.

## How to Define a Service?

it's really easy to define a Serivce, here's a snippet that does exactly that...

```python
from fabric.core.service import Service

class MyService(Service):...
```

but since we didn't dive into how Signals and Properties work. an empty Service won't be able do anything except existing.

I will leave this example here to revisit it later when we learn more about Service accessories...

```python

from fabric.core.service import Service, Signal, Property

class NameService(Service):
	@Signal
	def name_changed(self, new_name: str) -> None:...

	@Property(str, flags="read-write")
	def name(self) -> str:
		return self._name

	@name.setter
	def name(self, value: str):
		self._name = value
		self.name_changed(value)

	def __init__(self, name: str | None = None):
		super().__init__()
		self._name = name or ""

name_service = NameService()

name_service.connect(
					 "name-changed",
					 lambda new_name: print(f"the name has changed, new name is {new_name}")
)

name_service.name = "Homan"

```

## Signals

A `Service` can have various accessories, with `Signal`s being one of them.

`Signal`s provide a simple state-management model, allowing a `Service` to notify its users when specific changes occur. Additionally, a `Signal` can pass arguments, enabling the `Service` to both notify its users of a change and provide relevant details through these arguments.

### Defining Signals

To define a signal, first decide on a signal name in kebab-case (e.g., `signal-name`) to ensure it appropriately represents its purpose. Once the name is chosen, you can define the signal using the `Signal` decorator within a `Service`.

A signal's handler function must be fully typed, meaning all its arguments and return types must be explicitly declared.

To import the `Signal` decorator:

```python
from fabric.core.service import Service, Signal
```

Example of using the `Signal` decorator:

```python
@Signal
def signal_name(self, arg1: str, arg2: int, arg3: float) -> None: ...
```

Since Python doesn't allow function names with hyphens (as in kebab-case), you can define the function using snake_case (`signal_name`), and Fabric will automatically convert it to the correct kebab-case format when needed.

Let's walk through an example of how `Signals` work:

```python
class NameService(Service):
    @Signal
    def name_changed(self, new_name: str) -> None: ...

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.name = ""

    def get_name(self) -> str:
        return self.name

    def set_name(self, new_name: str) -> None:
        self.name = new_name

        # Emit the "name-changed" signal
        self.name_changed(new_name)

        # Alternative ways to emit a signal:
        # self.name_changed.emit(new_name)
        # self.emit("name-changed", new_name)

name_service = NameService()

# Connect a listener to the "name-changed" signal
name_service.connect(
    "name-changed",
    lambda new_name: print(f"The name has changed, new name is {new_name}")
)

# Alternative way to connect to the signal
# name_service.name_changed.connect(...)

# Trigger the signal by changing the name
name_service.set_name("Homan")
```

**Output:**

```
The name has changed, new name is Homan
```

In this example, the `NameService` class defines a `name_changed` signal that is emitted whenever the name is updated. The signal is connected to a listener, which prints the new name when it is changed.

By using `Signals`, services can easily notify other parts of the application about important state changes.

### Connections

`Service`s offer a simple way to connect signals to callback functions directly within the constructor (`__init__`). This allows for easy signal handling right at initialization.

Here's an example on how to connect signals to a callback in a various ways:

```python
def callback():
    print("I've been called")

# using a Fabricator as the service
fabricator = Fabricator(
    poll_from=lambda: "hello there!",
    interval=1000,

    # signal connections
    on_changed=callback,  # Connect the "changed" signal to the callback
    notify_value=lambda *_: print("value notified")  # Connect to "notify::value" for property changes
)

# alternative ways to connect signals
fabricator.connect("changed", callback)
fabricator.changed.connect(callback)  # works specifically for Fabric services

# fabricator.connect("notify::value", lambda *_: print("value notified"))
```

This pattern allows you to define signal connections directly in the constructor or through explicit method calls, providing flexibility in how you manage your signals.

## Properties

In a `Service`, properties are attributes that represent the state or data managed by the service.

Since `Property` inherits from `GObject.Property`, it uses GObject's properties system, which provides native support for type safety, property change notifications, and binding capabilities with other properties or UI elements.

### Defining Properties

To define a property, use the `@Property` decorator from the `fabric.core.service` module. it requires a specific data type and optional flags. Here’s an example:

```python
from fabric.core.service import Service, Property

class MyService(Service):
    @Property(str, flags="read-write")
    def status(self) -> str:
        return self._status

    @status.setter
    def status(self, value: str):
        self._status = value

    def __init__(self, status="", **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self._status = status
```

In this example, a `Property` named `status` is defined with a specific type (`str`) and flags (`"read-write"`) using the decorator, as well as `setter` function for it.

### Property Notifications

Since `GObject.Property` automatically emits a `notify::property_name` signal whenever the property value changes, other components can connect to this signal to track updates.

To connect a callback function that listens to property changes, there are several approaches:

1. **Using `connect` with `notify::property_name`**  
   This is the most explicit way to connect to a property notification signal.

   ```python
   example_service = MyService("Initializing")

   # Connect to the notify::status signal for the status property
   example_service.connect("notify::status", lambda *_: print("Status has changed"))
   example_service.status = "Running"
   ```

2. **Using a Direct Argument in `Service` Constructor**  
   Since we pass `**kwargs` over to the `super` which's a `Serivce`, You can also pass the callback directly as a keyword argument when initializing the `Service`, using `notify_<property_name_in_snake_case>` as the argument name.

   ```python
   # Initialize MyService with a callback for the status property notification
   example_service = MyService(
       initial_status="Initializing",
       notify_status=lambda *_: print("Status has changed")
   )
   example_service.status = "Running"
   ```

**Output:**

```
Status has changed
```

Each method achieves the same result but offers flexibility in how you structure your code. Using constructor arguments (`notify_<property_name_in_snake_case>`) can keep your property connections tidy, especially if they are set up at initialization.

## Builders

The builder pattern allows for constructing complex objects step by step. In the context of a `Service`, you can chain function calls to set properties and connect signals in one line, simplifying the setup process. This approach minimizes boilerplate code and makes the initialization more readable and efficient.

Here’s an example of how to use the builder pattern to initialize a `Fabricator` object:

```python
fabricator = Fabricator(
    poll_from=lambda: "hello there!",
    interval=1000,
).build()\
 .connect("changed", lambda *_: print("changed"))\
 .connect("notify::value", lambda *_: print("value notified"))\
 .set_value("initial value")\
 .unwrap()  # Return the actual Fabricator, not the Builder object
```

**Explanation:**

- `build()`: Initializes the builder object, which allows chaining subsequent calls.
- `connect()`: Connects signals, here linking the "changed" and "notify::value" signals to their respective handlers (which are inline functions created using lambdas).
- `set_value()`: Sets the initial value of the service.
- `unwrap()`: Returns the actual `Fabricator` instance instead of the builder object. This step is important because, without it, you'd still be working with the builder object rather than the fully constructed `Fabricator`.

This chaining method enables you to configure the service in a single expression, making it cleaner and more efficient.

Alternatively, you can configure the `Service` using a callback that receives two arguments: the `Service` instance itself (`self`) and the builder object used for chaining. This approach provides more flexibility if you want to further customize your service during initialization.

Here’s how to use the callback method:

```python
fabricator = Fabricator(
    poll_from=lambda: "hello there!",
    interval=1000,
).build(
    lambda self, builder: builder\
        .connect("changed", lambda *_: print("changed"))\
        .connect("notify::value", lambda *_: print("value notified"))\
        .set_value("initial value")
)
```

**Explanation:**

- The callback receives two arguments: the `self` reference to the `Service` instance and the `builder` object. This allows you to use the builder to chain function calls as needed, configuring signals and setting values in a flexible manner.
- The chaining functions (`connect()`, `set_value()`, etc.) work the same way as in the previous example, but this method allows you to encapsulate the configuration logic within a callback.

### Why Use the Builder Pattern?

The builder pattern simplifies service initialization, enabling you to configure everything in a single expression or using a callback for more complex setups. It’s especially useful when you want to avoid multiple setup steps spread throughout your code and prefer a more declarative style.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Readability**: Function chaining creates a fluent interface, making code more readable by consolidating setup logic in one place.
- **Flexibility**: You can configure services in one line or use callbacks for more advanced initialization.
- **Cleaner Code**: Reduces the need for multiple lines of initialization logic, resulting in less boilerplate code.

This pattern is ideal when working with `Services` that require property setting, signal connections, and other initialization logic in a clear and concise way.
